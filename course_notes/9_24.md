## Slicing:
```python
odds = [3, 5, 6, 7]
list(range(1, 3))
[odds[i] for i in range(1, 3)]
odds[1:3]#(include lower bound exclude higher bound)
```

## Sequence Aggregation:
sum: built in functiosn.
```
sum(iterable[, start]) ----> value
```
code:
```python
sum([2, 3, 4])
sum([2, 3, 4], 5)
[2, 3] + [4]
sum([[2, 3], [4]], [])
```
