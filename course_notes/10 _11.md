## Terminology
```
<expression>.<name>
```
## Attribute Assignment Statements
attribute-change in the class can be passed into all the object setup before. 
```
tom_account.interest: 0.2 ~ 0.4
```
## Inheritance
a method for relating classes together.
```python
class <name>(<base class>)
    <suite>
```
### looking up attribute names on classes
if get the attribute in the class, return the attribute value.

otherwise, look up the nmae in the base class, if there is one.

## object-oriented Design
don't repeat yourself, use existing

## inheritance and composition
inheritance is best for representing is-a relationships.

composition is best for representing has-a relationships.

### demo:
```python
class Bank:

```
## Multiple Inheritance
