list(numerals)
numerals.values()
list(numerals.values())

## Trees

A tree has a root label and a sequence of branches. Each branch of a tree is a tree. A tree with no branches is called a leaf. Any tree contained within a tree is called a sub-tree of that tree (such as a branch of a branch). The root of each sub-tree of a tree is called a node in that tree.

The data abstraction for a tree consists of the constructor tree and the selectors label and branches. We begin with a simplified version.

```python
def tree(label, branches=[]):
    for branch in branches:
        assert is_tree(branch)
    return [label] + branches

def label(tree):
    return tree[0]

def branches(tree):
    return tree[1:]

def is_tree(tree):
    if type(tree) != list or len(tree) < 1:
        return False
    for branch in branches(tree):
        if not is_tree(branch):
            return False
    return True

def is_leaf(tree):
    return not branches(tree)
```

### Tree Processing:
```python
def fib_tree(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return tree(n)
    else:
        left, right = fib_tree(n - 2), fib_tree(n - 1)
        return tree(label(left) + label(right), [left, right])

def count_leaves(t):
    if is_leaf(t):
        return 1
    else:
        return sum([count_leaves(b) for b in branches(t)])
