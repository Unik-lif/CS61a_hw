### Measuring Efficiency
```python
def count(f):
    def counted(n):
        counted.call_count += 1
        return f(n)
    counted.call_count = 0
    return counted
```
by using this kind of function we can add counting ability to the former function.

Therefore we can find out the efficiency.

### Memoization
```python
def memo(f):
    cache = {}
    def memoized(n):
        if n not in cache:
            cache[n] = f(n)
        return cache[n]
    return memoized
```
use memoize way to speed up the fib bad recursion.

### Exponentiation
goal: one more multiplication lets us double the proble size
```python
def exp(b, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return b * exp(b, n - 1)

def exp_fast(b, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        return square(exp_fast(b, n // 2))
    else:
        return b * exp_fast(b, n - 1)

```
