## review

### Decorators:

can use @trace to print message of fn.

In fact, @trace1 means "square = trace1(square)". It is very simple in reality.
```python
def trace1(fn):
    def traced(x):
        print('Calling', fn, 'on argument', x)
        return fn(x)
    return traced

@trace1
def square(x):
    return x * x

def sum_squares_up_to(n):
    k = 1
    total = 0
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + square(k), k + 1
    return total
```

## counting partitions.

```python
def count_partitions(n, m):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 0
    elif m == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        with_m = count_partitions(n - m, m)
        without_m = count_partitiosn(n, m - 1)
        return with_m + without_m
```
