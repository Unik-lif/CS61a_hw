### Decorators:

can use @trace to print message of fn.

In fact, @trace1 means "square = trace1(square)". It is very simple in reality.
```python
def trace1(fn):
    def traced(x):
        print('Calling', fn, 'on argument', x)
        return fn(x)
    return traced

@trace1
def square(x):
    return x * x

def sum_squares_up_to(n):
    k = 1
    total = 0
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + square(k), k + 1
    return total
```
