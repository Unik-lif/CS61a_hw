my own work based on CS61a courese.

Thanks for sharing the video and materials online from which I've learned a lot.

Some Ideas and Tricky ways are useful and exciting for me to do it.

notes is paritally given in the course_notes directory.

for sql and final, I think it might be a little boring, so i ignore them.
